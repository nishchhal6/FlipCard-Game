**Memory Match Game**:
Memory Match is a classic card-flipping game developed using modern design principles. The aim is to test players' memory skills by finding matching pairs of cards from a shuffled deck. Performance is tracked via moves and time, allowing players to challenge themselves and improve.

Game Overview:

1. Objective: Flip cards to reveal their faces and find matching pairs. Complete the board with the fewest possible moves and in the shortest time.

2. Difficulty Levels: Choose from Easy (4x4 grid, 8 pairs), Medium (6x6 grid, 18 pairs), or Hard (8x8 grid, 32 pairs).

3. Progress Tracking: The game tracks the number of moves taken and time elapsed for each session.

4. Modern User Interface: The interface features smooth color gradients and clear navigation for an engaging experience.

How It Works:

1. On starting the game, select a difficulty level that determines the grid size and total pairs.

2. The game board displays face-down cards arranged in the chosen grid.

3. Flip two cards by tapping them; if they match, they remain revealed. If not, they are flipped back.

4. Continue matching pairs until all cards are revealed.

5. The moves counter and timer help monitor progress and efficiency.
